- Manage multiple courses with their:
  - Modules

    - Pages
    - Assignments
    - Quizzes
    - Outcomes
    - Collaborations (Real-Time)
    - Conferences
    - Files
  - People
    - Profile
    - Grades
    - Attendance
  - Chats
    - Public Forum
    - Private Message
  - Settings
    - Metadata
    - Course Section
    - Module Navigation
    - External Apps Integration (like Zapier, IFTTT, Slack, etc)
    - Beta Features    
    - Notifications
- Each account can have multiple roles in the course.
- Restrict ranged content for particular tagged accounts.
- Capable to have master data, that can sync to multiple branched courses.
- Basic content or template generator from JSON config.
- Real code and GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket integration.
- JSON-based content data sharing, copy, delete/purge, importer, and exporter.
- etc is still WIP.

Inspired by Canvas LMS, edX, Teachable, Khan Academy, and many more.
